## **LiveRail**

> Live train tracking by utilization of mobile GPS and cell phone tower triangulation of travelers
----------------
How we planned it:
- User opens our app
- User tries to track a train location, gets offered option of "On the Train" or otherwise
- If user chooses the affirmative, we check if he isn't lying (we've brainstormed over how to do this (; )
- Based on such multiple searches/regular interval location update from users who choose to allow live location upload, we update the train location independent from the Indian Railways APIs.

How we have fared so far:
- Pretty well.
